I tried to figure out, but nothing she would say,
For my questions pestered her, my tears made her embarrassed.
I never wanted to be a priority, but a little love was all I expected.
I still kept giving, giving, day in and out.
But all went in vain, when all she beheld were doubts.
Doubts of an uncertain tomorrow, so she told me, ‘I have to go.’
My dreams, my wishes, my love were shattered in a single blow.
I stood by the balcony, looking into the thin air.
I clung on to her picture, crying silently so that no one saw.
All I begged of my fate, was a sight of her.
Occupied with things important, she had moved on well in life.
It was never tough for her, for I was another man by her side.
She thought I must be over her by then; least was she aware that I died each day.
I moved out, I had forgotten how it felt being loved.
I sought a place to pour my heart out, I looked below and above.
When saw no place to confine, saw no place to cry my heart out,
I kept walking towards a dead end, against the fate I had enough fought.
I reached the valley, stood there high, saw down the abyss and looked behind.
When saw no one who would call me back, I let my body be taken down by the wind.
They located my body amidst the woods, with a note in my hand clutched tight.
And a picture of her in my hand. It read, ‘I will love you till I die, don’t let her
know of my death, She might live life in guilt.
Just tell her I went to a place afar,
And though I loved her still.’
I stood there while they laid my corpse; a kid asked me who he was
I told him ‘A part of me ’.\n'''*times)
